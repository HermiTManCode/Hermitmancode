Hey there! I’m **Anthony**—a creator who’s just as comfortable wielding a soldering iron as I am a keyboard. I transform discarded tech into innovative gadgets, craft clever code  and build immersive digital worlds in **Godot**. Whether I’m repurposing e-waste into smart devices or debugging the latest game mechanic, I’m all about blending logic with creativity.  

### ✨ What I Do  

🔧 **DIY Electronics: Turning E-Waste into Genius Creations**  
♻️ Who needs new tech when you can reinvent old tech? I salvage forgotten gadgets and transform them into functional masterpieces that pack personality—and a bit of chaos.

🖥️ **Custom Projects with ESP32**  
🔌 From smart home gadgets to interactive devices, I harness the power of the ESP32 to bring ideas to life. If it doesn’t have an ESP32, does it even count?

🎮 **Game Development in Godot: Crafting Digital Worlds, One Bug at a Time**  
🕹️ I develop immersive games in Godot where every bug is a quirky part of the adventure. Debugging? It’s just another level to conquer!

💻 **Problem Solving with Code: Automating the Chaos**  
🐍 **Python** | 💾 **C++**—I write code that automates tasks, fixes hiccups, and turns everyday problems into elegant solutions. It’s all about finding the smart way through the madness.
